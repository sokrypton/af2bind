# AF2BIND: Prediction of ligand-binding sites using AlphaFold2
Predicting ligand-binding sites, particularly in the absence of previously resolved homologous structures, presents a significant challenge in structural biology. Here, we leverage the internal pairwise representation of AlphaFold2 (AF2) to train a model, AF2BIND, to accurately predict small-molecule-binding residues given only a target protein. AF2BIND uses 20 "bait" amino acids to optimally extract the binding signal in the absence of a small-molecule ligand. We find that the AF2 pair representation outperforms other neural-network representations for binding-site prediction. Moreover, unique combinations of the 20 bait amino acids are correlated with chemical properties of the ligand.

The pipeline for large proteins can be found here: https://github.com/arteemg/af2bind_prod/blob/main/af2bind_large_pdb.ipynb

# Code example

We run af2bind on the PDB file 6w70 to get the predictions. 
To run the code, you should define the af2bind function, which is located in af2bind.ipynb.

```
target_pdb = "6w70" 
target_chain = "A"

mask_sidechains = True
mask_sequence = False

target_pdb = target_pdb.replace(" ","")
target_chain = target_chain.replace(" ","")
if target_chain == "":
  target_chain = "A"

pdb_filename = get_pdb(target_pdb)

clear_mem()
af_model = mk_afdesign_model(protocol="binder", debug=True)
af_model.prep_inputs(pdb_filename=pdb_filename,
                     chain=target_chain,
                     binder_len=20,
                     rm_target_sc=mask_sidechains,
                     rm_target_seq=mask_sequence)

r_idx = af_model._inputs["residue_index"][-20] + (1 + np.arange(20)) * 50
af_model._inputs["residue_index"][-20:] = r_idx.flatten()

af_model.set_seq("ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY")
af_model.predict(verbose=False)

o = af2bind(af_model.aux["debug"]["outputs"],
            mask_sidechains=mask_sidechains)
pred_bind = o["p_bind"].copy()
```
